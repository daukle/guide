# 1. Your first project

**Every file quoted on this page is a real file in this repository, and CI fails if a quote here
stops matching it.** That is the whole reason this guide is a repository rather than a wiki: a
snippet nobody runs is a claim, and this project has spent long enough removing claims.

The project on this page is `projects/first-project/`. You can clone it and run it.

## What daukle is

daukle is **a plugin API and nothing else**. It knows no languages, ships no compiler and has no
build logic. Everything it can do for you arrives as a plugin, which is a Lua file it fetches and
pins by digest.

That has one consequence worth internalising before anything else: **the manifest declares, and
daukle acts**. You do not write build steps.

## The manifest

```toml file=projects/first-project/daukle.toml
schema = 1
project = "example/first-project"
version = "1.0.0"

[modules]

# Where a dependency comes from. daukle/path reads <path>/daukle.toml, which is
# the shape to use while a producer publishes no release of its own.
[sources."example/greeter"]
kind = "path"
path = "./producer"

# How daukle fetches a plugin. A resolver turns "owner/name@range" into a url,
# and this one is pinned by digest so the fetch cannot change under you.
[resolvers.github]
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daukle/daukle/f9055f9a07011283009675f4ffbc0a9b783c50bd/plugins/github-releases.lua"
sha256 = "3789865c266eb53fafcf7300d77a24461170c615195d92d0ddf88078c556e23e"

# daukle itself knows no languages. Everything it can do arrives here.
[plugins]
path = { resolver = "github", coordinate = "daukle/path@^1.0.0" }
npm = { resolver = "github", coordinate = "daukle/npm@^1.0.0" }

# A consumer is a file daukle keeps in step with the manifest. daukle owns the
# lines it wrote and leaves everything else in the file alone.
[[consumers]]
id = "node"
language = "npm"
file = "package.json"
configuration = "dependencies"

  [consumers.dependencies."example/greeter"]
  version = "^2.0.0"
  modules = ["cli"]
```

Four things are going on, and they are the four concepts the rest of the guide builds on.

**A source** says where a dependency's description comes from. Here it is a directory; it could be
a GitHub release.

**A resolver** turns a coordinate into a url. It is itself a plugin, pinned by digest, because the
thing that decides what gets downloaded is the last thing you want unpinned.

**A plugin** is an ability. `daukle/npm` can write a `package.json`; `daukle/path` can read a
producer from a directory. Without them this manifest does nothing at all.

**A consumer** is a file daukle keeps in step. It is not a file daukle owns: your `package.json`
keeps everything you put in it.

## The producer

The thing being depended on describes itself, once, for every language:

```toml file=projects/first-project/producer/daukle.toml
schema = 1
project = "example/greeter"
version = "2.0.0"

# One module, and what it is called on npm. A producer states this once and
# every consumer language reads the same table: the npm name and range live
# here rather than in each consumer's own build file.
[modules.cli]

  [modules.cli.npm]
  package = "cowsay"
  range = "^1.6.0"
```

**This is the point of the indirection.** The consumer asks for `example/greeter`'s `cli` module.
It never names `cowsay`. If the greeter renames its npm package, consumers do not change.

## Running it

```sh
daukle sync     # bring the project into line with the manifest
daukle check    # exit non-zero if a sync would do work
```

`sync` writes; `check` changes nothing and tells you whether a sync would. `check` is what belongs
in CI.

## What you get

Starting from a `package.json` holding only your own `left-pad`:

```json file=projects/first-project/expected/package.json
{
  "name": "example-first-project",
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "left-pad": "^1.3.0",
    "cowsay": "^1.6.0"
  },
  "daukle": {
    "managed": {
      "dependencies": [
        "cowsay"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**`left-pad` is untouched.** daukle added `cowsay` and wrote down, under `daukle.managed`, that
`cowsay` is the line it owns. Remove the dependency from the manifest and the next sync removes
exactly that line and nothing else. **That ledger is why daukle can edit a file it does not own
without ever deleting something you wrote.**

## What this page does not cover

**Compiling anything.** This project writes a dependency into a file; it provisions no toolchain
and runs no compiler. Page 4 does that.

**Why the plugins are pinned the way they are.** Page 2.
